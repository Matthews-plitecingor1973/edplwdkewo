> Just walked out of the theater and my brain's still buzzing, you know? Like when you unplug a fridge and it’s quiet but with that eee sound, you know? In the Lost Lands... imagine chewing gum and stepping into a wool sweater, all prickly and strangely soft at the same time. 

Man, the theater was louder than I'd like, that type of hum like a cat purring right next to your ear but not in a comforting way. More like a distant lawn mower. More like, Why is there still popcorn in my shoe from last time?

So, the   — I remember someone telling me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it but honestly, if you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   on a small screen, you’d be losing out on the grand glacier landscapes that feel like an ice cream headache in winter. Somehow th3y captured the feeling of standing too close to a campfire one second, and hanging by the Arctic the next. I swear there’s at least a dozen shots where I forgot to breathe, and one was when my back reminded me it’s only borrowed strength, screeching like a stubborn hinge halfway through.

There was that scene — gods, it was like a tapestry unwinding, threads and all... A flying dragon, only it wasn't a dragon but seemed more like a deflated parade balloon. Reminded me of the time my cousin tried to ride an inflatable unicorn in a pool, looking majestic and sort of dumb.

And the witch! I forget her name, it’s like tasting cotton caramel, where the sugar bites back. She's cold but mesmerizing, like the frost creeping over car windows on the first real night of fall — beautiful but gets in the way when you're late. I think her spellcasting was like clicking random keys on a piano and getting the Moonlight Sonata.

> Oh, and there's this character, I swear he looked just like my uncle’s friend Steve, which is nuts because you remember Steve always wears mismatched socks, right? Anyway. Meandering monologues; I wasn’t always sure who was talking to whom, space folded like origami, or maybe my attention span is a goldfish too.

You ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 through clutter, a pile of popcorn crumbs under your shoe heel, trying to sit up straight because this is after all, a world unfolding? The seats were probably intended for someone who can bend like a willow branch — and not snap 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬le popping like cereals in milk.

So the ending though, kaleidoscope of chaos brewed into something — a sneeze stuck in a time loop. But it fit, or didn’t fit, like trying to open a can of beans with a spoon. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you need to relive how disorganized beauty and mayhem can be one and the same — like grandma's attic after the cats had their way.
